# Music Application
App for music recognition through lyrics, song’s name, singer/band’s name. Outputs information about the song/singer/band: albums, video clip, description etc... Our target audience is for those music lovers who heard some great music clips on the train or when shopping in the shopping center or when they accidentally just could not recall a song or a singer’s full name. In this scenario, they are dying to know the name and the singer so that they could listen to the song and the singer’s other albums.
